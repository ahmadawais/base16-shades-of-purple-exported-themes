## Shades of Purple for Base16

**Exported themes from the Shades of Purple for Base16 color scheme.**

This repo mainly serves to hold the themes exported from the official templates, so that if anyone wants [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/demartini/base16-shades-of-purple) for a specific application, they don't have to go through the entire Base16 builder/scheme/generation process if they don't want to.
